        <!-- <h1>NECK TRICK </h1> -->
      <h1> ADDITIONAL    &nbsp  SKILLS </h1>
     <p>
 <b>==> I am learning computer programming skills to be a web developer and I have built this web page.
</b><br> 
<b>==> I have good written and spoken English/communication skills.
</b><br>

 <b>==> I was born in South India and can speak Telugu language too.</b><br>    
<b>==> Iam an aspiring fiction writer and I have done,
 "in-person" research
in various sectors, including  but not limited to warehouse work,
insurance sales,short time Christian missionary work
 in India,Nepal,Belize &USA.</b><br>
<b>==> I was awarded the 'Best lady speaker ' award by Jaycees in 1991.
</b><br>
 <b>==> I was awarded the 'Best singer ' award at AP state level singing competitions. in 1991
</b><br>
 
 <b>==> I love to sing,&nbsp crochet,&nbsp swim,&nbsp 
embroider, and cook(slightly varying the recipe) to suit 
South Indian tastes!
</b><br>   
</p>
    <p><b>==> Iam a good follower and submit to my authorities.</b><br>
          <p2>My dad used to quote a highest caste prime minister,
          Mrs Indira Gandhi about <b>neck trick</b>.I remember that !
           And whenever my husband says,"Just do it !",
            I reply,"Ok!" Sometimes I say,
            "You're the head " and add to mself,"Iam the neck" !
            That keeps things in the correct perspective for me
            and removes the sting, out of the pain of having to submit
            to my man. Bitterness is nipped in the bud. Bitterness is
            not merely covered up, to <em><b>" fester out of sight" </b></em>, but it is totally destroyed.
            So I continue to learn to  be better at necessary skills,
            instead of being bitter about- 'having to be submissive',
 to the head(my husband).
            Iam the neck! <br>
            The neck gets to wear the priceless pretty,
 necklace : <em><b>my kid's loving hands, when she hugs me&nbsp!!</b></em> 
           </p2><br> <br><p>
            <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/97089b6b-7328-4599-bd5d-84eb986b5ee5/1dMostPreciousNecklace.png" alt="MyNeckIsRewardedWithMyKidsLovingHandsAroundMyNeck" style="width:1200px;height:600px;">
            <br><br>

 
==><b>I write short essays on human nature and conflict resolution. </b><br>
<p1>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It is healthier for the neck, to push a head up than
 to pull a head up.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            So the neck stays submissively , under the head to
 
            push it up.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp They are interdependent - 
just as ...  <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
 men and women are interdependent !<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
            The rich and poor are interdependent too !<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Political parties are interdependent too !<br>
